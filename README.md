# codetest
A Tsugi tool to authomatic assess programming and database exercises.

# Project Summary
This codetest module installed into Tsugi form **LTI-Judge**, a virtual judge that supports programming and database training.
Its main strength is that it **can be integrated in any LMS like Sakai or Moodle** throughout the IMS standard. Having the ability to grade the self-correcting exercises inside the Learning Management System yields to multiple advantages. From the learner point of view, it allows to define adaptive learning pathways. On the other hand, it eliminates the requirement of reviewing the well resolved exercises, so that the teacher can spend its time on correcting the student misunderstandings.

The objective of this project is to create a community of teachers working around this tool in order to extend its functionality and to propose new use cases, carrying out new **Intellectual Objects** and the **exchange of good practices** among all the organizations involved.
